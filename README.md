# sam-engine

This project is build using aws sam (serverless application model) where we can define our infrastucture as a code and use lambda functions as api, cron function and more. This provide us a simple way to manage infrastructure serverless, being charged by demand, so we can focus on code and business rules.
This project uses python 3.11, its strongly recommended to use pyenv to manage multiple versions of python to run this project, its a best practice instead of install a new version of python global in your computer.

##If you choose pyenv to install python:

Here we have a simple reference to install pyenv
https://dev.to/womakerscode/instalando-o-python-com-o-pyenv-2dc7

for ubuntu/debian dependencies:

```
sudo apt update; sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

 run:

```
pyenv install 3.11.0
pyenv local 3.11.0
```

### required tools
* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)





## Run local
Its provided a makefile with some commom functionalities to improve the developer experience.

commands:

- **make install** - will create the virtual environment for python project and install the dependencies from requirements.txt (should be run first to prepare our environment).
- **make test** - will run all tests.
- **make lint** - will run flake 8 lib to check a code style from pep8.
- **make format** - will format our project based in pep8 code style using the lib black.

### Steps:
- clone the project 
```
git clone https://github.com/gabriel-f-santos/engine
```
- install dependencies
```
make install
```
- write your code, test and apply code style
```
make format
make test
```
Your tests should be capable of simulate behaviour of the software, but we could call the lambda function locally passing the event we want

```
sam local invoke CreatePolicyFunction --event events/event.json
```

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.


## Deploy the sample application

The project its already with CI/CD using github actions, in every merge we make deploy of the new version of the software

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.


#Project structure:

###Creating a Tenant
To create a tenant (to permit multiple clients), you can use the following API endpoint with a POST request::

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://76x998fgo7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/create-tenant \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/2023.5.8' \
  --data '{
		"name": "tenant teste",
		"email": "tenant3@gmail.com",
		"password": "123password"
}'

{"message": "Tenant created sucessfully"}%
```
###Tenant Login and Structure Creation

After creating a tenant, they can log in to obtain their credentials. They can then create a structure (used for the frontend) with the token jwt received and an API key will be generated to allow the backend of the tenant to make requests to evaluate values in your engine.


```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://76x998fgo7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/login \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/2023.5.8' \
  --data '{
		"email": "tenant3@gmail.com",
		"password": "123password"
}'


{"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0ZW5hbnRfaWQiOjMsImFwaUtleSI6IjExMDlhOTMyMmI4YTNkZWExMmUxZDNjZDg2ZjQ5ZDAyIiwiZXhwIjoxNjk3MzI4NjQ1LCJzdWIiOiJ0ZW5hbnQzQGdtYWlsLmNvbSJ9.L2hkj6S_-wfzwT4TEJPIS-Ct-XDAI6epIwGYILlCvlA", "apiKey": "1109a9322b8a3dea12e1d3cd86f49d02"}%
```
###Creating a Policy 
The frontend, using JWT, can create a rule, and the backend will associate this rule/policy with the tenant. Conditions available for policies are:

- gt: Greater than
- gte: Greater than or equal to
- lt: Lower than
- lte: Lower than or equal to
- eq: Equal to
- ne: Not equal to

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://76x998fgo7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/create-policy \
  --header 'Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0ZW5hbnRfaWQiOjMsImFwaUtleSI6IjExMDlhOTMyMmI4YTNkZWExMmUxZDNjZDg2ZjQ5ZDAyIiwiZXhwIjoxNjk3MzI5MTY0LCJzdWIiOiJ0ZW5hbnQzQGdtYWlsLmNvbSJ9.iulY4-ChwoTUyZiIpiarSU5TMG7GIi5iOaKDvUEfXQI' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/2023.5.8' \
  --data '{
		"name": "Policy 3",
		"policy_details": {
				"1": {
						"condition": "gt",
						"field": "age",
						"threshold": 20
				},
				"2": {
						"condition": "gte",
						"field": "income",
						"threshold": 3000
				}
		}
}'

{"message": "policy created"}%
```
### Using the Engine Rule
Now, the tenant can use their engine rule. As defined previously, if age is greater than 20 and income is greater or equal to 3000, the application should be approved.


```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://76x998fgo7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/create-engine \
  --header 'Authorization: 1109a9322b8a3dea12e1d3cd86f49d02' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/2023.5.8' \
  --data '{"age": 21, "income": 3000}'
{"decision": true}% 
```

With income less than 3000:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://76x998fgo7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/create-engine \
  --header 'Authorization: 1109a9322b8a3dea12e1d3cd86f49d02' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/2023.5.8' \
  --data '{"age": 21, "income": 2999}'
{"decision": false}% 
```
